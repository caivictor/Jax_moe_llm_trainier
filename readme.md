***JAX Moe LLM Training Pipeline***


Okay, based on the main.py script in the jax_moe_llm_project document, here's how you would typically invoke it to start training:

Save the Project: Make sure you have saved all the files (main.py, requirements.txt, and the files in the configs, data, model, optimizer, training, utils directories) locally on your machine in the structure I provided (e.g., inside a main folder named jax_moe_llm_trainer).
Install Dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate inside the jax_moe_llm_trainer directory, and install the required packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: You might need to install a specific version of JAX depending on your hardware (CPU/GPU/TPU). Refer to the official JAX installation guide.
Configure: Edit the configs/config.yaml file to set your desired hyperparameters, dataset paths, model size, checkpoint directories, etc.
Run the Script: While still inside the jax_moe_llm_trainer directory in your terminal, run the main.py script using Python:

Bash

python main.py [OPTIONS]


The script will load the configuration, initialize the dataset, model, and optimizer, and then start the training loop defined in `training/trainer.py`. You should see output messages in your terminal indicating the progress (loading data, initializing model, training steps, logging, etc.).

### Command-Line Options

The following command-line arguments are supported:

*   `--config <path>`: Specifies the path to the configuration YAML file.
    *   Default: `configs/config.yaml`
    *   Example: `python main.py --config my_custom_config.yaml`
*   `--eval_only`: If present, the script will skip training and run evaluation only, loading the latest checkpoint found according to the configuration.
    *   Example: `python main.py --eval_only`
    *   Example (with custom config): `python main.py --config configs/config.yaml --eval_only`
