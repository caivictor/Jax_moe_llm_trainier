***JAX Moe LLM Training Pipeline***


Okay, based on the main.py script in the jax_moe_llm_project document, here's how you would typically invoke it to start training:

Save the Project: Make sure you have saved all the files (main.py, requirements.txt, and the files in the configs, data, model, optimizer, training, utils directories) locally on your machine in the structure I provided (e.g., inside a main folder named jax_moe_llm_trainer).
Install Dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate inside the jax_moe_llm_trainer directory, and install the required packages:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Note: You might need to install a specific version of JAX depending on your hardware (CPU/GPU/TPU). Refer to the official JAX installation guide.
Configure: Edit the configs/config.yaml file to set your desired hyperparameters, dataset paths, model size, checkpoint directories, etc.
Run the Script: While still inside the jax_moe_llm_trainer directory in your terminal, run the main.py script using Python:

Bash

python main.py --config configs/config.yaml


The --config configs/config.yaml part tells the script where to find your configuration file. Since configs/config.yaml is the default value in main.py, you might also be able to just run python main.py, but explicitly specifying it is good practice.
This command will load the configuration, initialize the dataset, model, and optimizer, and then start the training loop defined in training/trainer.py. You should see output messages in your terminal indicating the progress (loading data, initializing model, training steps, logging, etc.).
